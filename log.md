### R1D1

**Today's Progress**: Made it up to how to use CSS Selectors to Style Elements.

**Thoughts**: **#CodeNewbie** here.

Joined **#FreeCodeCamp** and started the **HTML5 & CSS Challenges** in order to get the **Front End Development Certification**. After dropping out from a code bootcamp [which I have no longer the need to mention ;-)] it feels very weird to be back at this. Maybe the guilt of failure is haunting me and trying scare me away of doing the right thing and facing the challenge once again.


### R1D2

**Today's Progress**: Learned: How to style multiple elements with a CSS Class, importing Google fonts, adding & resizing images, adding styled borders to elements.


**Thoughts**: I finally get to understand how a class works from a very basic perspective. I felt good today since I understood every challenge without blocking out.


### R1D3

**Today's Progress**: At **#FreeCodeCamp** learned to link External Pages with Anchor Elements, Nest Anchor Elements within a Paragraph, Created a Bulleted Unordered List, Created an Ordered List, attended my first **#CodeNewbie** twitter chat and it was awesome! All within 1hr or so.

### R1D11

**Today's Progress**: Learned to Target the same element with multiple jQuery Selectors, Remove Classes from an element, Change the CSS of an Element, Disable an Element, Change Text Inside an Element.


**Thoughts**: Halfway there to finish the jQuery unit. My hopes to be able to truck it by tomorrow.

### R1D13

**Today's Progress**: Started building the layout of my tribute page for #freeCodeCamp 's challenge.


**Thoughts**: Still don't know who's going to be tributed. Will concentrate in using Bootstrap for most of the page.


### R1D14

**Today's Progress**: Took time to read through CSS and Bootstrap documentation. Afterwards, I used Codepen.io to practice in realtime everything that cought my attention.


**Thoughts**: Still deciding on who's going to be tributed in my page, but in the meantime, I just work on the layout of the page.

``alert('Message received. You have written ' + charactersWritten + ' characters, you have ' + charactersLeft + ' left.');``

### Day10  #100DaysOfCode

Felt pretty cool to understand what I have learned so far and use it to do a simple - but useful- task. To Greet a user while making sure their name is cased correctly no matter how they input it. 👨🏻‍💻 Hells yeah! 🍻 #BeerTime

### Day25  #100DaysOfCode

2/28/2019: 1st Qtr of my challenge. These days have been tough, but managed to code a bit or two. Created random number functions for the dice rolls, using JavaScript.

### Day26  #100DaysOfCode

3/1/2019: Created a function to change the dice images according to the random number obtained. 

### Day27  #100DaysOfCode

3/2/2019: Created if-else statements that will change the title to display a winner.

### Day28  #100DaysOfCode

3/3/2019: The page is running the script when it finishes loading. Automatically displaying a winner instead of the title and default dice. I have been searching for a way to prevent this and nothing comes to mind yet. 🤔🤯

### Day29  #100DaysOfCode

3/4/2019: Since the page is loading up already displaying a winner and I have to click reload to keep playing the game, I will change the function to run when you click a button. Is there a way to run JavaScript only after the page is refreshed? 🤔

### Day30  #100DaysOfCode

Done making HTML, CSS & JavaScript changes in order to make the page work as I wanted. It has been a nice challenge! 👨🏻‍💻 You can check it out at:

juanBurgos.drinkBeer();

### Day35  #100DaysOfCode

3/10/2019: Learned how to add methods to constructor functions in JavaScript. Now I understand how that bit of code that makes audio play is built. 🤯

### Day36  #100DaysOfCode

### Day37  #100DaysOfCode

Did not complete the challenge by myself. Hit play to see what the solution was. I got grasp of concepts entirely new for me that I need to work on: Passing functions as parameters, and functions as callbacks. 🤯

juanBurgos.keepPushing();

### Day38  #100DaysOfCode

JavaScript: Practiced Higher Order & Callback Functions. Created a function that adds a CSS Class to a button on keypress/click, then used setTimeout() to remove that class after x amount of time resulting on a simple animation. Next: jQuery

### Day39  #100DaysOfCode

Practicing JS and jQuery by coding the functionality of a Simon Game. The random color selector and array of patterns are ready. Simple, but got me confused for the entire hour. LOL

-------------Resumed 08/18/2019------------------
### Day40  #100DaysOfCode
Returning from a hiatus. Time to get some coding done. Have to review JS and jQuery. Added this course to my TODO: CS50's Introduction to Computer Science.

### Day41  #100DaysOfCode
