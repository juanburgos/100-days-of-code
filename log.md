## Log

### R1D1

**Today's Progress**: Made it up to how to use CSS Selectors to Style Elements.

**Thoughts**: **#CodeNewbie** here.

Joined **#FreeCodeCamp** and started the **HTML5 & CSS Challenges** in order to get the **Front End Development Certification**. After dropping out from a code bootcamp [which I have no longer the need to mention ;-)] it feels very weird to be back at this. Maybe the guilt of failure is haunting me and trying scare me away of doing the right thing and facing the challenge once again.


### R1D2

**Today's Progress**: learnt: How to style multiple elements with a CSS Class, importing Google fonts, adding & resizing images, adding styled borders to elements.


**Thoughts**: I finally get to understand how a class works from a very basic perspective. I felt good today since I understood every challenge without blocking out.


### R1D3

**Today's Progress**: At **#FreeCodeCamp** learnt to link External Pages with Anchor Elements, Nest Anchor Elements within a Paragraph, Created a Bulleted Unordered List, Created an Ordered List, attended my first **#CodeNewbie** twitter chat and it was awesome! All within 1hr or so.

**Thoughts**: Thinking about not having much time free, today I managed to code for an hour and cover some ground. It was really hard to squeeze it in my schedule, but all it takes is true commitment. Let's rock on!


### R1D6

**Today's Progress**: learnt to add Different Margins to Each Side of an Element, Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Margin of an Element, Style the HTML Body Element, Inherit Styles from the Body Element, Override Styles in Subsequent CSS, Override Class Declarations by Styling ID Attributes, Override Class Declarations with Inline Styles, Override All Other Styles by using Important, Use Hex Code for Specific Colors, Use Hex Code to Mix Colors, Use Abbreviated Hex Code, Use RGB values to Color Elements, Use RGB to Mix Colors.

**Thoughts**: Halfway there to finish the jQuery unit. My hopes to be able to truck it by tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: *JQuery*: learnt to Remove an HTML Element, Use appendTo to Move Elements, Clone an Element, Target the Parent and Children of an Element, Target a Specific Child of an Element, Target Even/Odd Numbered Elements and Modify the Entire Page.


**Thoughts**: Done with the basics of jQuery. Now on to start building basic front end projects. Next... Build a Tribute Page!


### R1D13

**Today's Progress**: Started building the layout of my tribute page for #freeCodeCamp 's challenge.


**Thoughts**: Still don't know who's going to be tributed. Will concentrate in using Bootstrap for most of the page.


### R1D14

**Today's Progress**: Took time to read through CSS and Bootstrap documentation. Afterwards, I used Codepen.io to practice in realtime everything that cought my attention.

### Day29  #100DaysOfCode

3/4/2019: Since the page is loading up already displaying a winner and I have to click reload to keep playing the game, I will change the function to run when you click a button. Is there a way to run JavaScript only after the page is refreshed? ü§î

### Day30  #100DaysOfCode

Done making HTML, CSS & JavaScript changes in order to make the page work as I wanted. It has been a nice challenge! üë®üèª‚Äçüíª You can check it out at:

juanBurgos.keepPushing();

### Day38  #100DaysOfCode
