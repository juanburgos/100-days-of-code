## Log

### R1D1 

**Today's Progress**: Made it up to how to use CSS Selectors to Style Elements. 

**Thoughts**: **#CodeNewbie** here.

Joined **#FreeCodeCamp** and started the **HTML5 & CSS Challenges** in order to get the **Front End Development Certification**. After dropping out from a code bootcamp [which I have no longer the need to mention ;-)] it feels very weird to be back at this. Maybe the guilt of failure is haunting me and trying scare me away of doing the right thing and facing the challenge once again.


### R1D2

**Today's Progress**: Learned: How to style multiple elements with a CSS Class, importing Google fonts, adding & resizing images, adding styled borders to elements.


**Thoughts**: I finally get to understand how a class works from a very basic perspective. I felt good today since I understood every challenge without blocking out.


### R1D3

**Today's Progress**: At **#FreeCodeCamp** learned to link External Pages with Anchor Elements, Nest Anchor Elements within a Paragraph, Created a Bulleted Unordered List, Created an Ordered List, attended my first **#CodeNewbie** twitter chat and it was awesome! All within 1hr or so.

**Thoughts**: Thinking about not having much time free, today I managed to code for an hour and cover some ground. It was really hard to squeeze it in my schedule, but all it takes is true commitment. Let's rock on!

**Thoughts**: Still don't know who's going to be tributed. Will concentrate in using Bootstrap for most of the page.


### R1D14

**Today's Progress**: Took time to read through CSS and Bootstrap documentation. Afterwards, I used Codepen.io to practice in realtime everything that cought my attention. 


**Thoughts**: Still deciding on who's going to be tributed in my page, but in the meantime, I just work on the layout of the page.
