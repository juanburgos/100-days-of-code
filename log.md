## Log

### R1D1 

**Today's Progress**: Made it up to how to use CSS Selectors to Style Elements. 

**Thoughts**: **#CodeNewbie** here.

Joined **#FreeCodeCamp** and started the **HTML5 & CSS Challenges** in order to get the **Front End Development Certification**. After dropping out from a code bootcamp [which I have no longer the need to mention ;-)] it feels very weird to be back at this. Maybe the guilt of failure is haunting me and trying scare me away of doing the right thing and facing the challenge once again.


### R1D2

**Today's Progress**: Learned: How to style multiple elements with a CSS Class, importing Google fonts, adding & resizing images, adding styled borders to elements.


**Thoughts**: I finally get to understand how a class works from a very basic perspective. I felt good today since I understood every challenge without blocking out.


### R1D3

**Today's Progress**: At **#FreeCodeCamp** learned to link External Pages with Anchor Elements, Nest Anchor Elements within a Paragraph, Created a Bulleted Unordered List, Created an Ordered List, attended my first **#CodeNewbie** twitter chat and it was awesome! All within 1hr or so.


**Thoughts**: Although I did not spent so much time like I would have liked to, I felt that this hour was very productive. Understood every learned concept without significant problems. 


### R1D4

**Today's Progress**: Learned text input fields, Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field, Create a Form Element, Add a Submit Button to a Form, Use HTML5 to Require a Field, Create a Set of Radio Buttons, Create a Set of Checkboxes, Create a Set of Checkboxes, Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default, Nest Many Elements within a Single Div Element, Give a Background Color to a Div Element. 


**Thoughts**: Just feel like I learned a lot today. Felt productive and engaged. 


### R1D5

**Today's Progress**: Learned to set the ID of an Element, Use an ID Attribute to Style an Element, Adjusting the Padding of an Element, Adjust the Margin of an Element, Add a Negative Margin to an Element, Add Different Padding to Each Side of an Element.


**Thoughts**: Thinking about not having much time free, today I managed to code for an hour and cover some ground. It was really hard to squeeze it in my schedule, but all it takes is true commitment. Let's rock on!


### R1D6

**Today's Progress**: Learned to add Different Margins to Each Side of an Element, Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Margin of an Element, Style the HTML Body Element, Inherit Styles from the Body Element, Override Styles in Subsequent CSS, Override Class Declarations by Styling ID Attributes, Override Class Declarations with Inline Styles, Override All Other Styles by using Important, Use Hex Code for Specific Colors, Use Hex Code to Mix Colors, Use Abbreviated Hex Code, Use RGB values to Color Elements, Use RGB to Mix Colors.
